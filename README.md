# interpn

Python bindings to the `interpn` Rust library for N-dimensional interpolation and extrapolation. 

## Features
| N-dimensional Grid Type â†’<br>â†“ Interpolant Method | Regular | Rectilinear |
|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| Linear            |   âœ…    |     âœ…      |
| Cubic             |   âœ…    |     ðŸ’¡      |

The methods provided here, while more limited in scope than scipy's, are
* significantly faster (1-2 orders of magnitude under most conditions)
* use almost no RAM (and perform no heap allocations at all)
* produce significantly improved floating-point error (by 1-2 orders of magnitude)
* are json-serializable using Pydantic
* can also be used easily in web and embedded applications via the Rust library
